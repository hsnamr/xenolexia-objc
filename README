Xenolexia is an idea and a framework designed around helping you learn a new language by selectively translating words in your favorite book. Every few pages, a few words are translated into the target language. This way as you read a book in your native tongue, you will gradually buildup vocabulary in the language you want to learn.

For now, it is a proof of concept, with support limited to HTML documents

The ultimate goal is:
1. variable difficulty
2. support for open and unencyrpted ePub format
3. actual .framework that can be added with CocoaPod and Carthage
